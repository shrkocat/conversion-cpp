# Converter
This program is a converter coded in ***C++*** that is tasked to prompt the user to make choice to use whether to convert a four-digit number into roman numerals (e.g., ***I***, ***IV***) or convert a four-digit number into military time (***0000-2359***). Where the user is also given the choice to close the program upon selection.

## C++
This program does not use looping statements or iteration, but instead utilizes conditional statements (***if***, ***else if***, ***else***). Where the program executes these algorithms when the input variable matches the ***switch case*** value with its own specified and distinct instructions.
